"When handling very large raster layers it is often convenient, and higher "

msgstr ""

"output pixel colors would be selected such that the average of the pixels "
"would more closely approximate the desired color. Dithering also takes "
"advantage of all currently allocated colors, not just those in the color "
"cube. Dithering requires GDAL 1.1.9 or later, and is enabled by providing "
"the `PROCESSING` \"DITHER=YES\" option in the mapfile. Dithering is more CPU"
