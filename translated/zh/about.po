"MapServer is an `Open Source`_ geographic data rendering engine written in "
"C. Beyond browsing GIS data, MapServer allows you create \"geographic image "
"maps\", that is, maps that can direct users to content. For example, the "
"Minnesota DNR `Recreation Compass "
"<http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/maps/compass.html>`__ provides users with more "
"than 10,000 web pages, reports and maps via a single application. The same "
"application serves as a \"map engine\" for other portions of the site, "
"providing spatial context where needed.  For more live examples, please see "
"the MapServer `Site Gallery <https://github.com/mapserver/mapserver/wiki"
"/MapServer-Site-Gallery>`__."

"MapServer was originally developed by the University of Minnesota (UMN) "
"ForNet project in cooperation with NASA, and the Minnesota Department of "
"Natural Resources (MNDNR). Later it was hosted by the TerraSIP project, a "
"NASA sponsored project between the UMN and a consortium of land management "
"interests."
msgstr "MapSever 源于美国明尼苏达大学 (University of Minnesota，UMN) 与美国国家航空和宇航局-NASA 以及明尼苏达自然资源部门 (MNDNR) 合作的 ForNet 项目。之后该项目由 TerraSIP 项目组主持。TerraSIP 是由 UMN 以及一个土地管理组织建立并由 NASA 赞助的项目组。"
