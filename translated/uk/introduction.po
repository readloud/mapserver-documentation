"the current state of your application (e.g. map image name, reference image "

" when searching through a large Shape dataset or image of which you are only"
" going to display a small area.  By breaking the data up into tiles and "
"creating a tile index, MapServer only needs to open up and search the data "
"files of interest.  Shape datasets can be broken into smaller tiles and then"
" a tileindex Shape dataset can be created using the :ref:`tile4ms <tile4ms>`"
" utility. A :ref:`tileindex <tileindex>` Shape dataset for raster files can "
"also be created."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../en/introduction.txt:862
msgid ""
"**Pre-Classify Your Data** - MapServer allows for the use of quite complex "
":ref:`EXPRESSIONs <expressions>` to classify data. However, using logical "
"and regular expressions is more resource intensive than string comparisons."
"  To increase efficiency, you can divide your data into classes ahead of "
"time, create a field to use as the `CLASSITEM` and populate it with a simple"
" value that identifies the class, such as 1,2,3, or 4 for a four class data "
"set.  You can then do a simple string comparison for the class `EXPRESSION`."
