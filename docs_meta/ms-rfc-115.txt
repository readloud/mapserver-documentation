:Status: Draft
:Version: MapServer 7.0

1. Motivation
=============

The MapServer Tutorial and Demo packages are very outdated and need some love. 
This result in a very bad first impression for new users testing the software.

In this RFC, we propose a plan to address this situation.

2. Proposed plan
================

* review current docs
* build example data package
* create updated version for OSGeoLive DVD
* create new tutorial structure

Work and discussion is done in fork of docs repository [1]. We'll update from upstream repository when necessary. 

3. Backwards Compatibility
==========================

It is proposed that the tutorials work with both MapServer 6.4 and 7.0+
The existing tutorials, based around MapServer 5.0, could perhaps be moved to an 
archive section in the documentation. 

4. Implementation Details
=========================

Data Package

* vector data (OSM, NaturalEarth)
* raster data (SRTM, satellite imagery, DEM)

Review current tutorial docs

* remove outdated information and external links

The current situation is that tutorials are duplicated in different places, with some links updated in one place
and not another. 

For example the main tutorial section is on the documentation site at http://demo.mapserver.org/tutorial/sections.html
However sections 3 and 4 of the tutorials are simply links to http://demo.mapserver.org/tutorial/section3.html
The http://demo.mapserver.org site also duplicates sections 1 and 2. 

In addition the OSGeo Live CD has a tutorial section which is more recent, and could perhaps be used as the basis of the 
tutorials on the MapServer documentation site: http://live.osgeo.org/en/quickstart/mapserver_quickstart.html

Current tutorial titles, to review and decide if they are still relevant with 
modern MapServer usage. 

**Section 1: Static Maps and the MapFile**

* 1.1 - Map with a single layer
* 1.2 - Map with two layers from a single shapefile
* 1.3 - Using classes to create a "useful" map

* Addendum (more examples):

* 2.5 - Reference map

**Section 3: Query and More HTML Templates**

* 3.1 - Class-level Query Template
* 3.2 - Layer-specific Header and Footer Templates
* 3.3 - Map-wide Header and Footer Templates
* 3.4 - The QueryMap
 
**Section 4: Intro to Advanced Interfaces**
